# [Snow City](https://snow-city.world/)

This project is a dynamic web application designed to automatically update its pages upon data insertion or modification in the database. 
The primary goal was to achieve real-time updates with using RDS like AWS Aurora, but I thought it would be enough to use DynamoDB, so I donâ€™t use RDS.

- **Frontend:** Vue 3 (Node.js 18)
- **Backend:** Spring Boot 3 (Java 17)
