This project is a near real-time dynamic web application designed to automatically update its pages upon data insertion or modification in the database. 
The primary goal was to achieve real-time updates with using RDS like AWS Aurora, but I thought it would be enough to use DynamoDB, I didnâ€™t use RDS.
